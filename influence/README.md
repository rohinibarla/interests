### Influencing works...
  
These are the collection of works done by people, either in form of software creation, organization building, product development, talk, presentation, way of life, wisdom, insights, books, blogs, tweets, FB posts, articles, essays and many other forms which I have not enumerated.  
  
Person, blog, website, twitter, FB, company, talks, youtube channel... all are related.  
  
How do we organise these data and such that this is all connected.  
  
I would be seeing blogs list... one blog could have the person's details in people list. one might not have it. How do we represent such data in a static website format?  
  
given some details.. it will update few data items to represent the changes needed. to be displayed based on the context of which lens you are looking it into.  
  
The articles which contain some new way of changing the basic framework of thinking has to be listed in a post... like linked list.  
  
Essentially the people who inspire to do lot of things.  
  
Some are popular one's.  
  
Some are unknown one's but they inspire you very well.  

Just collect all those people.  

Essays/Articles/Books that influenced me. Simply put... Words that influenced me...  
  
Words or thoughts or stories or worlds... insights or their wisdom...
